# HashSet :vs: TreeSet
In many permutations/subset generation problems question demand for unique and sorted elements in it, so for that we can use TreeSet which follow both of these properties.
On the other hand, Hashset only handle unique but can't handle ordering whereas TreeSet can handle ordering of elements.

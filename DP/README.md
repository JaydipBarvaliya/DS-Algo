Anyone who is getting confused with Top-down and bottom up, Recursion memoization is always TOP-DOWN(and not bottom up),
as we take a bigger problem and recusively solve for the smaller subproblems. Whereas in tabular DP where we start filling
the table from top left to bottom right is actually BOTTOM-UP because we compute dp values of smaller subproblems first and
then using these values compute dp value of bigger problems.

PS: Top down and Bottom up is decided by the essence of methodology and not by whether we are filling table from top to bottom or vice versa!
